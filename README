#Objective:  To have a simple way to keep track of users files,
#            make sure there are not duplicates of files, and a 
#            verifiable way to check the integrity of the scanned 
#            files.
#
#Goals:   1) Locate every file from the current working directory
#            and put meta data about those files in a table that 
#            is database preferably in a hidden directory under 
#            the home directory
#         2) Hash each file for duplication checking purposes
#            and file ingerity purposes

#
#   Database:   The project can add meta data of files into a MySQL database
#
#   Hash:       The hashing of each file is done with pythons md5 function
#
#   Dupe Check: Take hash, check to see if there is already an existing
#               table entry that has that hash, append in the fileids column; 
#               if the entry does not exist create new entry and append in 
#               fileids column

#Things TODO
#   
#   Database:  1)  Determine a better way to create the conf file
#              2)  Allow the use of other databases especially 
#                  SQLite
#              3)  Create a database abstraction layer  
#
#   Hash:      1)  Allow other hashing functions
#              2)  Research the speed of using python hashing vs other
#                  hashing mechnisms like bash or a C program
#   
#   Help Text:  1)  Write HT for index
#               2)  Write HT for hash
#               3)  Write HT for dupes
#               4)  Write HT for cdupes
#
#   Install:    1)  Create install flag
#               2)  Create installation process
#                 a)  Create directory in the home file named .filtra
#                 b)  In the .filtra directory the conf file will live,
#                     the SQL database will live there if that was the
#                     option that was chosen
